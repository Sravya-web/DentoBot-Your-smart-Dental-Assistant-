# 🦷 Dentobot — Your Smart Dental Assistant  
An AI-powered dental awareness chatbot designed to educate users about oral hygiene, offer preventive care guidance, and provide quick, accessible dental information.

This GitHub repository contains the complete UX case study, user research insights, user personas, storyboard, and low-fi & high-fi designs for the Dentobot project.

---

## ⭐ Project Overview  
Dentobot is built to bridge the gap between patients and dental professionals by offering simple, accurate, and friendly dental guidance. It helps users understand common dental issues, get preventive care tips, and know when they must visit a dentist.

---

## Problem Statement  
Many patients lack clear awareness about oral hygiene.  
They often:
- Search online and get confused  
- Delay dental visits  
- Forget post-treatment instructions  
- Ask repeated basic questions  
- Struggle to identify if a symptom is serious  

Dentists, on the other hand, spend a lot of time repeating the same information daily.

Dentobot solves this by acting as a **24/7 smart dental assistant**.
